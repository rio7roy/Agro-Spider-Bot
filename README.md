# Agro Spider Bot
A hardware project of mine that has given me the oppurtunity to present it at prestigious institute such as IIT Guwahati and IIT Palakkad
It is basically an Agricultural Rover that use legg mechanism instead of wheels.
Why you ask? to scale steep ans rough terrain smoothly with minimal crop disturbance.
